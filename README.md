# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a very simple website that meets the criteria of the project. I focused mostly on object positioning, and less on actual content.

I also desired to take advantage of SCSS's functionality that eliminates some of the repetition found with using vanilla css.

Aside from that, I feel good with the look and colors of my website. I will use it as a foundation for a real site that I make for myself in the future.
